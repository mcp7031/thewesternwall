            National sovereignty is the cornerstone of a nation's identity and security, encompassing the ability to defend its borders, safeguard its resources, and ensure the well-being of its citizens.
            This policy statement outlines our commitment to upholding and strengthening national sovereignty through various measures, including defense capabilities, voting privileges, and environmental preservation.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        The ability to defend our nation against external threats is paramount to maintaining national sovereignty. We recognize the importance of a robust defense infrastructure, including well-trained armed forces equipped with modern technology and strategic alliances with like-minded nations. We pledge to invest in the development and enhancement of our defense capabilities to ensure the security and sovereignty of our nation.
                        Furthermore, we acknowledge the sacrifices made by our armed services and reserve members in safeguarding our nation's interests. Therefore, we are committed to providing them with the necessary support, including adequate resources, healthcare benefits, and voting privileges, to honor their service and uphold their rights as citizens.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">

                        Armed services and reserve members play a vital role in defending our nation's sovereignty and upholding its values. As such, they deserve the right to participate fully in the democratic process by exercising their voting privileges. It is clear that a democracy requires defending and therefore, it is only those prepared to defend it that are permitted to vote.
                        Active duty military personnel, reservists, and veterans will be able to cast their votes, regardless of their deployment status or geographic location.
                        To become a reservist, two years of training, annual fitness tests, and availability for active duty is required.
                        By ensuring that armed services and reserve members have access to voting resources, we empower them to have a voice in shaping the future of our nation and contributing to its democratic governance.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Preserving our natural resources and economic infrastructure is essential for maintaining national sovereignty and ensuring the prosperity of future generations.
                        We recognize the interconnectedness between environmental sustainability, economic stability, and national security.
                        Therefore, we are committed to implementing policies that promote responsible stewardship of our natural resources, including land, water, and energy sources.
                        This includes investments in renewable energy, conservation efforts, and sustainable development practices to mitigate environmental degradation and protect biodiversity.
                        Additionally, we prioritize the maintenance and modernization of our economic infrastructure, including transportation networks, energy grids, and communication systems.
                        By investing in critical infrastructure projects, we strengthen our resilience to external threats and enhance our ability to adapt to evolving challenges while safeguarding our national sovereignty.

            Our political ideology centres on the empowerment of the individual. Government exists to serve the people and must always be transparent and accountable to its citizens. We pledge to protect and uphold freedom of thought and expression as fundamental to our democracy. Our commitment includes enshrining the NZ Bill of Rights to safeguard the sacred rights of individuals and prevent overreach, as seen during the challenges posed by events like forced vaccinations and restrictions on personal freedoms.

            A fundamental reconnection with New Zealand's core values is imperative. We endorse values that strengthen our communities, such as supporting strong families.
            We are determined to reignite Kiwi initiative and innovation. Our agenda includes rectifying policies that we deem unlawful, including those related to
            Co-Governance, He Puapua, Three Waters, the Therapeutic Products Bill, and race-based legislation. Moreover, we will establish a People's Commission to address
            the real challenges posed by the COVID crisis, focusing on healing divisions and promoting truth and reconciliation.

            We are committed to fostering a more inclusive political system, one that encourages greater participation by all those affected by governmental decisions.
            Our gradual reforms will seek innovative solutions that restore trust in the political process and inspire active engagement by all New Zealanders.
            In recent years, our parliamentary system has lost touch with its primary purpose and has been influenced by external powers. Our party will champion a comprehensive overhaul of the political system to realign it with the interests of the people it serves.
            We advocate for greater reliance on local government where it is practical, and we support a reduction in the size of government, including fewer MPs, lower salaries, and retirement packages for politicians.
            We also endorse term limits to reduce the prevalence of career politicians, ensuring that elected officials remain accountable and responsive to the needs of New Zealanders.
            We recognize that certain groups within New Zealand have been marginalized, and we pledge to engage with representatives of health professionals, farmers, small shopkeepers, and businesspeople to find solutions based on their recommendations.
