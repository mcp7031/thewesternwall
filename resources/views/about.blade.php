                There is something that I believe has been hereto unacknowledged by the freedom community, and that is grief.  We all react to trauma in different ways, and we all need to grieve our loss.  All of us who are unvaccinated have had violence inflicted upon us – a form of social and medical tyranny.  This is not the first time in history that this has occurred as former mandatory vaccination programs have also had devastating consequences.  However, it is unique in its scope, technology, and the number of people now cognizant of global conspiratorial ambitions and a changing medical paradigm.

                Because of the increased consciousness, some even want to claim there is a Great Awakening, even a Mother-of-all-Revelations.  This coincides with the upcoming election in the US where Trump is seen as the Saviour who will drain the swamp and restore normalcy to the light-on-the-hill which is the American Republic.  I say these social phenomena are symptoms of grief.

                For there is not only the violence of the vaccine mandates but the imposition of communist politics which has undermined our way of life.  It is a strange human characteristic, in Western culture, to deny trauma and grief but there are lessons we might learn from our Jewish cousins, who after being exiled to Babylon and having their temple destroyed, now grieve and pray at the only remaining Western Wall (known as the wailing wall).  It is a way to remind themselves of the warnings of the prophets that they would be a conquered people if they failed to repent, to change their ways and do what is right and good.

                We, as a people, have also had our warnings and continue to do so.  There are many indicators that our circumstances will continue indefinitely and need to be mitigated. One of the factors that will permit circumstances to continue is shame.  You may yourself feel a deep shame to be human knowing that so many are as stupid as sheep, completely amoral and unfit for human relationships.  Certainly, those who are vaccinated and particularly those who pushed for mandates and social apartheid are despicable and shameful people.

                This is why there will not be any justice.  It takes courage to meet your shame. If you cannot identify yet with the shame, then consider distress.  The distress of the reality of a profoundly reduced mating pool.  Who would want to be married and have children with someone who, for the sake of conformity, would consider your death and that of your children.  Who, even in good conscious, believed it was the right thing to do? Would you want to live with the consequences of such a malformed conscious?  Would you want to have children with someone who has been injected with a technology for which the consequences are still unfolding and for which the motivation to discover the extent of the harm is virtually non-existent, both emotionally and financially?

                We are gregarious beings but discernment around relationship is significant, particularly in marriage.  Like it or not, there are things people do, while not necessarily defining them, can have such long-term consequences that it effectively defines them.  You could be married four times, or you could have murdered someone.  It’s going to be considered by other people.  You got injected three times?  You’ve got to be kidding.

                If you are in denial about grieving over this, then I think you just need to accept you’re in denial.  However, you need to grieve.  There is no panacea and there is no savior from this crime against humanity.  You need to stop demanding justice from criminals and the sheep.  You need to find mitigating circumstances and solutions for you and your children, grieve the loss of humanity and rebuild.  That is the Western Wall Project.

                    This website comes out of the work of Rock The Vote, uses Telegram, and a Discourse server to facilitate groups and conversations in areas of concern such as education, food supply and farming, medical and health, politics, relationships and spirituality, community and environment.  I would eventually like to see a network of mothers concerned with homeschooling, or charter schooling.  A network of medical and holistic professionals being able to connect with people demanding better care.  A network of farmers and gardeners offering unvaccinated, organic foods.  The unvaccinated must remain unvaccinated and have the means to do so.

                    We are in the midst of a shift in a medical paradigm, and it will take some time for it to work its way through society.  It is time for the freedom movement to lay the first brick of the Western Wall and save itself.  Please watch this space.
